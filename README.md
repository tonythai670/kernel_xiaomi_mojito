# KernelSU for Mojito/Sunny
![Banner](/KernelSU.png)
## ‚ùó ATTENTION
If you use NetErnels in some rom and want to try the WestCoast or PixelExperience version of KernelSU, you must first flash the vendor_boot and dtbo of the rom and then try.

If you need help, **contact me**, NOT the official developers of their respective Kernels.

**Neither I nor the creators of Kernels are responsible** for possible damage caused.

**You assume the risk and responsibility** in proceeding with the installation.
